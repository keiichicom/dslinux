The pre-release includes 1 game with dldi disabled. Here is an example of it running on a Nintendo DSi XL:

Build Instructions: 

You need to first setup a VM with Debian Wheezy 7.11.0 i386 version and use that for your build.


Then follow the instructions here, except you would clone this repo instead of downloading it from Apache Subversion. I strongly suggest to download a pre-compiled toolchain rather than trying to compile it locally. The toolchain I used is in the source tree: dslinux-toolchain-2008-01-24-i686.tbz :
