       retawq - a multi-threaded web browser for text terminals

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       retawq  is  an interactive, multi-threaded network
       client (web browser) for text terminals on computers
       with Unix-like operating systems. It is written  in  C,
       fast, small, nicely configurable, and comfortable; e.g.
       the low-level network communications are performed  in
       a  non-blocking way,  and  you  can keep open as many
       "virtual windows" as you want and work simultaneously
       in two of them in a split-screen mode.

       The most recent version of retawq is available on the
       project home page <http://retawq.sourceforge.net/>.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       retawq  provides  dozens  of  compile-time,
       command-line  and run-time options, e.g. for
       internationalization/localization support  and  proxy
       configuration.  Too  many  to  explain them all here,
       but see also "see also"...
