       ttmmssnncc is a textbased chat client that uses
       the MSN protocol. The inter‐ face is written in
       the Ncurses library and the  SSL  part  in  OpenSSL.
       This  makes  the  program very portable and it should
       be able to run on any UNIX-like system.

              "brb", "busy", "idle", "phone", "lunch" or

       To enable translation of outgoing messages using
       talkfilters, you first have       to       install
       libtalkfilters      (http://www.hyper‐
       realm.com/main.php?s=talkfilters) and re-compile
       tmsnc.  Then you go to the "Actions->Set filter"
       menu-item. Enter one of the following filter- names:
       austro, b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, dubya,
       fudd, fune‐ tak, jethro, jive, kraut, pansy, pirate,
       postmodern, redneck, valspeak, or warez. You can also
       disable talkfilters by typing in "none". Now all your
       outgoing messages will get translated.

       Use  the  arrow  keys  to choose a contact. Press

       ccuussttoomm  nniicckk to give the
       selected contact a custom nickname.  Similarily
       while having a contact  selected  you  can un-set
       the  custom nickname by choosing the menu-item
       CCoonnttaaccttss-->>UUnn--sseett

       In order to display your current playing song you
       have to enable it  in ~/.tmsnc/tmsnc.conf  first.
       Uncomment the display_current_song option.  TMSNC
       updates the current playing song every 15  seconds  by
       executing ~/.tmsnc/current_song.sh. The output is sent
       the song's name.
