     ssnnaakkee is a display-based game which must be
     played on a CRT terminal.  The object of the game is
     to make as much money as possible without get‐ ting
     eaten by the snake.  The --ll and --ww options
     allow you to specify the length and width of the field.
     By default the entire screen is used.  The --tt option
     makes the game assume you are on a slow terminal.

     You are represented on the screen by an I.  The snake
     is 6 squares long and is represented by s's with an S at
     its head.  The money is $, and an exit is #.  Your score
     is posted in the upper left hand corner.

     You can move around using the same conventions as vi(1),
     the hh, jj, kk, and ll keys work, as do the arrow
     keys.  Other possibilities include:

     sseeffcc    These keys are like hjkl but form a
     directed pad around the d
             key.

     HHJJKKLL    These keys move you all the way in the
     indicated direction to the
             same row or column as the money.  This does
             _n_o_t let you jump away from the snake,
             but rather saves you from having to type a key
             repeatedly.  The snake still gets all his turns.

     SSEEFFCC    Likewise for the upper case versions on
     the left.

     AATTPPBB    These keys move you to the four edges
     of the screen.  Their posi‐
             tion on the keyboard is the mnemonic, e.g.
             P is at the far right of the keyboard.

     xx       This lets you quit the game at any time.

     pp       Points in a direction you might want to go.

     ww       Space warp to get out of tight squeezes,
     at a price.

     To earn money, move to the same square the money is on.
     A new $ will appear when you earn the current one.
     As you get richer, the snake gets hungrier.  To leave
     the game, move to the exit (#).

     A record is kept of the personal best score of each
     player.  Scores are only counted if you leave at the exit,
     getting eaten by the snake is worth nothing.

     As in pinball, matching the last digit of your score to
     the number which appears after the game is worth a bonus.

     To see who wastes time playing snake, run
     ssnnssccoorree.

     When playing on a small screen, it's hard to tell when
     you hit the edge of the screen.

     The scoring function takes into account the size of
     the screen.  A per‐ fect function to do this equitably
     has not been devised.
