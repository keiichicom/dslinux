       Print  the  value of EXPRESSION to standard output.
       A blank line below separates increasing precedence
       groups.  EXPRESSION may be:

       ARG1 | ARG2
              ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

       ARG1 & ARG2
              ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0,
              otherwise 0

       ARG1 < ARG2
              ARG1 is less than ARG2

       ARG1 <= ARG2
              ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 = ARG2
              ARG1 is equal to ARG2

       ARG1 != ARG2
              ARG1 is unequal to ARG2

       ARG1 >= ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 > ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than ARG2

       ARG1 + ARG2
              arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 - ARG2
              arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 * ARG2
              arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 / ARG2
              arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       ARG1 % ARG2
              arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       STRING : REGEXP
              anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING

       match STRING REGEXP
              same as STRING : REGEXP

       substr STRING POS LENGTH
              substring of STRING, POS counted from 1

       index STRING CHARS
              index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0

       length STRING
              length of STRING

       + TOKEN
              interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a

              keyword like `match' or an operator like `/'

       ( EXPRESSION )
              value of EXPRESSION

       Beware that many operators need to be escaped  or
       quoted  for  shells.  Comparisons are arithmetic
       if both ARGs are numbers, else lexicographi‐ cal.
       Pattern matches return the string matched between \(
       and  \)  or null;  if  \( and \) are not used, they
       return the number of characters matched or 0.

       Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0,
       1  if  EXPRESSION is  null  or  0,  2 if EXPRESSION
       is syntactically invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.
