     This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
     or against a "friend".  All commands are only one letter,
     so you don't need to type a carriage return, except at the
     end of a move.  The program is mostly self-explanatory,
     so that a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
     If you answer `y' when the program asks if you want the
     rules, you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
     some hints on strategy, instructions on how to use the
     program, and a tutorial consisting of a practice game
     against the computer.  A description of how to use the
     pro‐ gram can be obtained by answering `y' when it
     asks if you want instruc‐ tions.

     The possible arguments for backgammon (most are
     unnecessary but some are very convenient) consist of:

     --nn      don't ask for rules or instructions

     --rr      player is red (implies n)

     --ww      player is white (implies n)

     --bb      two players, red and white (implies n)

     --pprr     print the board before red's turn

     --ppww     print the board before white's turn

     --ppbb     print the board before both player's turn

     --tt _t_e_r_m
             terminal is type _t_e_r_m, uses
             _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p

     --ss _f_i_l_e
             recover previously saved game from _f_i_l_e

     Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An argument of
     a lone `-' gets a description of possible arguments.

     If _t_e_r_m has capabilities for direct cursor
     movement (see termcap(5)) bbaacckkggaammmmoonn
     ``fixes'' the board after each move, so the board
     does not need to be reprinted, unless the screen
     suffers some horrendous malady.  Also, any `p' option
     will be ignored.  (The `t' option is not necessary
     unless the terminal type does not match the entry in the
     _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p
     data base.)

QQUUIICCKK RREEFFEERREENNCCEE
     When the program prompts by typing only your color,
     type a space or car‐ riage return to roll, or

     dd       to double

     pp       to print the board

     qq       to quit

     ss       to save the game for later

     When the program prompts with 'Move:', type

     pp       to print the board

     qq       to quit

     ss       to save the game

     or a _m_o_v_e, which is a sequence of

     ss--ff     move from ss to ff

     ss//rr     move one man on ss the roll rr separated
     by commas or spaces and
             ending with a newline.  Available abbreviations
             are

             ss--ff11--ff22
                     means ss--ff11,,ff11--ff22

             ss//rr11rr22  means
             ss//rr11,,ss//rr22

     Use bb for bar and hh for home, or 0 or 25 as
     appropriate.
