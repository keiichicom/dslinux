       Dungeon  is  a  game  of adventure, danger, and
       low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the
       most amazing territory  ever  seen  by  mortal man.
       Hardened  adventurers  have  run screaming from the
       terrors con‐ tained within.

       In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the
       forgotten secrets  of a  lost  labyrinth  deep in
       the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures
       long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded  by
       fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

       Dungeon  was  created at the Programming Technology
       Division of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
       by  Tim  Anderson,  Marc  Blank,  Bruce Daniels,  and
       Dave  Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game
       of Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and  Dragons
       game  of  Gygax  and Arneson.   The original version
       was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version
       was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by  a  somewhat
       paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.

       On-line information may be obtained with the commands
       HELP and INFO.

       Following is the summary produced by the iinnffoo
       command:

              Welcome to Dungeon!

              You  are  near a large dungeon, which is
              reputed to contain vast quantities of treasure.
              Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
              In  order  to do so, you must of course remove
              it from the dungeon.  To receive full credit
              for it,  you  must  deposit  it safely in the
              trophy case in the living room of the house.

              In  addition  to valuables, the dungeon contains
              various objects which may or may not be useful in
              your attempt to get rich.  You may  need  sources
              of light, since dungeons are often dark, and
              weapons, since dungeons often have unfriendly
              things  wandering about.   Reading  material
              is  scattered  around the dungeon as well;
              some of it is rumored to be useful.

              To determine how successful you have  been,
              a  score  is  kept.  When  you  find  a
              valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
              certain number of points, which depends  on  the
              difficulty  of finding  the  object.  You receive
              extra points for transporting the treasure safely
              to the living room and  placing  it  in  the
              trophy  case.   In addition, some particularly
              interesting rooms have a value associated with
              visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting
              yourself killed, which you may do only twice.

              Of  special  note  is  a thief (always carrying
              a large bag) who likes to wander around in the
              dungeon (he has never been seen by the  light
              of  day).  He likes to take things.  Since he
              steals for pleasure rather than profit and  is
              somewhat  sadistic,  he only  takes  things
              which  you  have seen.  Although he prefers
              valuables, sometimes in his haste he may take
              something which is worthless.  From time to time,
              he examines his take and discards objects which
              he doesn't like.  He may occasionally  stop  in
              a room  you  are  visiting, but more often he
              just wanders through and rips you off (he is
              a skilled pickpocket).

       give some  idea  of  what
                      the game is about.

       qquuiitt           prints  your score and asks
       whether you wish to continue
                      playing.

       ssaavvee           saves the state of the game
       for later continuation.

       The iinnvveennttoorryy command may be
       abbreviated ii; the  llooookk  command  may
       be abbreviated ll; the qquuiitt command may be
       abbreviated qq.

       A  command that begins with '!' as the first character
       is taken to be a shell command and is passed unchanged
       to the shell via _s_y_s_t_e_m_(_3_)_.

       Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such
       containers  can  be opened  and closed.  The rest are
       always open.   They may or may not be transparent.
       For you to access (e.g., take) an object which  is  in
       a container,  the container must be open.  For you to
       see such an object, the container must be either open
       or transparent.   Containers  have  a capacity,  and
       objects have sizes; the number of objects which will
       fit therefore depends on their sizes.  You may  put
       any  object  you  have access  to  (it  need  not be
       in your hands) into any other object.  At some point,
       the program will attempt to pick it up if you don't
       already have  it, which process may fail if you're
       carrying too much.  Although containers can contain
       other containers,  the  program  doesn't  access more
       than one level down.

FFIIGGHHTTIINNGG
       Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back
       when attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if
       unprovoked.  Useful verbs here  are _a_t_t_a_c_k
       <villain>  _w_i_t_h <weapon>, _k_i_l_l, etc.
       Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
       fighting strength which  varies  with  time.  Being  in
       a  fight,  getting  killed, and being injured all lower
       this strength.  Strength is regained with time.  Thus,
       it is not a good idea to  fight someone immediately
       after being killed.  Other details should become
       apparent after a few melees or deaths.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD PPAARRSSEERR
       A command is one line of text terminated by  a
       carriage  return.   For reasons  of  simplicity,
       all words are distinguished by their first six
       letters.  All others are ignored.  For example,
       typing _d_i_s_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_e  _t_h_e
       _e_n_c_y_c_l_o_p_e_d_i_a is not only
       meaningless, it also creates excess effort for
       your fingers.  Note that this truncation may produce
       ambiguities in the intepretation  of  longer  words.
       [Also note that upper and lower case are equivalent.]

       You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which
       understands the fol‐ lowing types of things:

              AAccttiioonnss::
                   Among  the  more obvious of these, such as
                   _t_a_k_e_, _p_u_t_, _d_r_o_p_,
                   etc.  Fairly general forms of these may
                   be  used,  such  as _p_i_c_k _u_p_,
                   _p_u_t _d_o_w_n_, etc.

              DDiirreeccttiioonnss::
                   _n_o_r_t_h_,  _s_o_u_t_h_,
                   _u_p_,  _d_o_w_n_, etc. and their
                   various abbrevia‐ tions.  Other more
                   obscure  directions  (_l_a_n_d_,
                   _c_r_o_s_s)  are appropriate in only
                   certain situations.

              OObbjjeeccttss::
                   Most objects have names and can be
                   referenced by them.

              AAddjjeeccttiivveess::
                   Some  adjectives are understood and required
                   when there are two objects which can be
                   referenced with  the  same  'name' (e.g.,
                   _d_o_o_r_s_, _b_u_t_t_o_n_s).

              PPrreeppoossiittiioonnss::
                   It  may be necessary in some cases to
                   include prepositions, but the  parser
                   attempts  to  handle  cases  which  aren't
                   ambiguous  without.   Thus  _g_i_v_e
                   _c_a_r _t_o _d_e_m_o_n will work,
                   as will _g_i_v_e _d_e_m_o_n
                   _c_a_r.  _g_i_v_e _c_a_r
                   _d_e_m_o_n probably won't do any‐
                   thing  interesting.   When a preposition is
                   used, it should be appropriate; _g_i_v_e
                   _c_a_r _w_i_t_h _d_e_m_o_n
                   won't parse.

              SSeenntteenncceess::
                   The parser understands a  reasonable
                   number  of  syntactic construc-  tions.
                   In particular, multiple commands (sepa‐
                   rated by commas) can be placed on the
                   same line.

              AAmmbbiigguuiittyy::
                   The parser tries to be clever about what to
                   do in the  case of  actions  which  require
                   objects that are not explicitly specified.
                   If there  is  only  one  possible  object,
                   the parser  will assume that it should
                   be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
                   Most questions asked by the parser can
                   be answered.

BBUUGGSS
       For those familiar with the MDL version of the game
       on the ARPAnet, the following is a list of the major
       incompatabilties:
              -The first six letters of a  word  are
              considered  significant, instead of the
              first five.  -The syntax for _t_e_l_l_,
              _a_n_s_w_e_r_, and _i_n_c_a_n_t is
              different.  -Compound objects are not recognized.
              -Compound  commands  can  be  delimited  with
              comma  as well as period.

       Also, the palantir, brochure, and dead  man  problems
       are  not  imple‐ mented.
