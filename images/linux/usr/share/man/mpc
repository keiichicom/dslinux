       mpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. mpc
       connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local
       network and controls MPD according to commands  and
       arguments passed to it. If no arguments are passed,
       cur‐ rent status is given.

              Configure  the  format  of  song  display  for
              status  and  the playlist.   The  metadata
              delimeters  are "%name%", "%artist%", "%album%",
              "%title%", "%track%", "%time%", and "%file%".
              The [] operator  is  used  to  group  output
              such  that if no metadata delimeters are found
              or matched between '[' and ']',  then  none of
              the  characters between '[' and ']' are output.
              '&' and '|' are logical operators for and
              and or.  '#'  is  used  to  escape characters.
              Some  useful examples for format are: "%file%"
              and "[[%artist% - ]%title%]|[%file%]"

       This  section  describes some environment variables
       that affect how mpc operates.
                   MPD_HOST MPD_PORT
                        By default, mpc connects to
                        localhost:6600.  This  can
              be  changed either at compile-time, or by
              exporting the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment
              variables.
                        To use a password with  mpd,  set
                        MPD_HOST  to  pass‐
              word@host.

       Here is a script to load and play m3u playlists
       (useful for mozilla):

              #!/bin/bash mpc clear cat $1 | mpc add mpc play

       This  script  can be used to load and play pls playlists
       (again, useful for mozilla):

              #!/bin/bash mpc clear grep '^File[0-9]*' $1 |
              sed -e 's/^File[0-9]*=//' | mpc add mpc play

       Since MPD uses UTF-8, mpc needs to convert characters
       to  the  charset used  by  the local system. If you
       get character conversion errors when your running
       mpc you probably need to set up your locale. This
       is  done by  setting  any  of  the LC_CTYPE, LANG or
       LC_ALL enviroment vatiables (LC_CTYPE only affects
       character handling).
