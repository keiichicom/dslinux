       Each LIST is  made  up  of  one range,  or  many
       ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is written
       in the same order that it is read, and is written
       exactly  once.   Each range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end
       of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character
       or field

       --MM     from first to M'th (included) byte, character
       or field

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
