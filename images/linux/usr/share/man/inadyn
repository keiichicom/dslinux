DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       iinnaaddyynn  is  a  client for `open' name
       servers. That is, it let the user have an Internet
       recognized name for his machine by transferring to him
       some  control  over  a name server that he does not
       manage. Some of the services that are offered by  those
       open  name  servers  are  free  of charge,  and  work
       even when the client machine does not have a static IP.
       The   name   servers   that   are   supported   by
       iinnaayynn   are: http://www.dyndns.org ⟨⟩
       and http://freedns.afraid.org ⟨⟩

       Its  basic  operation is to periodically check whether
       the actual IP of the client machine is the same one
       that is recorded in the name server, and update the
       name server records when there is a mismatch.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _-_h_, _-_-_h_e_l_p
              Print a summary of the options to
              iinnaaddyynn and exit.

       _-_u_, _-_-_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
              The username, if applicable. This might be
              referred to as hash.

       _-_p_, _-_-_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d
              The password, if applicable.

       _-_a_, _-_-_a_l_i_a_s_[_,_h_a_s_h_]
              A  host  name  alias. This option can appear
              multiple times, for each domain that has the
              same IP.

       _-_-_i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e
              The file name that contains inadyn command
              options  exactly  as specified  in  the  command
              line  syntax (adds to those already present in
              the cmd line). The default configuration file
              name is '/etc/inadyn.conf'.  It  is looked
              at automatically if iinnaaddyynn is
              called without any  command  line  options.
              The  format  is  as expected for a **NIX config
              the hash character is used to com‐ ment entire
              lines. Spaces are ingored. The long options
              may  be specified without -- if placed at the
              beginning of the line.

       _-_-_i_p___s_e_r_v_e_r___n_a_m_e_[_:_p_o_r_t_]
       _u_r_l
              The   client   IP   is  detected  by  calling
              'url'  from  this 'ip_server_name:port'.
              Defaults to checkip.dyndns.org:80 /.

       _-_-_d_y_n_d_n_s___s_e_r_v_e_r___n_a_m_e_[_:_p_o_r_t_]
              The server that receives the update DNS
              requests. When no  proxy is  specified  it is
              sufficient to set the dyndns_system so that the
              default servers will be taken.  The  option
              is  useful  for generic DynDNS services that
              support HTTP update.

       _-_-_d_y_n_d_n_s___s_e_r_v_e_r___u_r_l
       _n_a_m_e
              The update path inside the DynDNS server.

       _-_-_d_y_n_d_n_s___s_y_s_t_e_m
              An  optional  DNS  service.
              For  http://www.dyndns.org  ⟨⟩
              the acceptable services are one of
              dyndns@dyndns.org,  statdns@dyn‐
              dns.org  or custom@dyndns.org. There
              is only one acceptable ser‐ vice   for
              http://freedns.afraid.org    ⟨⟩    ,    which
              is default@freedns.afraid.org.       Other
              services      are: default@zoneedit.com,
              custom@http_svr_basic_auth.  The  default service
              is  dyndns@dyndns.org,  which is believed to
              be used by most users, at least initially.

       _-_-_p_r_o_x_y___s_e_r_v_e_r_[_:_p_o_r_t_]
              An http proxy server name and port. The default
              is none.

       _-_-_u_p_d_a_t_e___p_e_r_i_o_d
              How often the IP is  checked.  This  value
              denotes  millisecond (There  are  1000
              milliseconds  in  one second). The default is
              about 1 minute. The maximum is 10 days.

       _-_-_u_p_d_a_t_e___p_e_r_i_o_d___s_e_c
              How often the IP is checked. Here the value
              denotes seconds. The default is about 1
              minute. The maximum value is 10 days.

       _-_-_f_o_r_c_e_d___u_p_d_a_t_e___p_e_r_i_o_d
              How  often  the  IP should be updated even if
              it is not changed.  The time should be given
              in seconds.

       _-_-_l_o_g___f_i_l_e
              The name, including the full path, of a log file.

       _-_-_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d
              run in background. Output is sent to the UNIX
              syslog  facilities or to a log file, if one
              was specified.

       _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Set the debug level, which is an integer between
              0 to 5.

       _-_-_i_t_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s
              Set  the  number  of  DNS updates. The default
              is 0, which means infinity.

       _-_-_s_y_s_l_o_g
              Explicitly sending the output to a syslog  like
              file,  such  as /var/log/messages.

       _-_-_c_h_a_n_g_e___p_e_r_s_o_n_a
       _u_i_d_[_:_g_i_d_]
              After  init  changes  user ID and group ID to
              the provided ones.  This allows dropping unneeded
              [root] privileges after startup.

              --dyndns_system default@freedns.afraid.org

       The 'hash' should be extracted from the grab url batch
       file that can be downloaded  from  the  site. A single
       hashed (base64 encoded) string is preferred upon a
       username and password pair, apparently to  reduce  the
       computational  resources  that is required on their
       side. Unfortunately the hash can not be computed by
       inadyn because it requires the index to the  username
       record  in the freedns database, which is not known. The
       simplest solution seems to be a copy&paste action
       from  the  grab  url batch file offered on their
       website. When the batch file looks is like

       graburl
       http://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?YUGIUGSEIUFGOUI‐
       HEOIFEOIHJFEIO=

       the hash string, which is what the user should copy
       and paste,  is  the string  that begins right after the
       '?' character and ends with the end of line. This string
       shell be used as the username in  inadyn  command.
       When  the user has several names then each name should
       be followed with that name hash string.

OOUUTTPPUUTT
       iinnaaddyynn prints a message when the IP is
       updated. If no update is  needed then  by  default it
       prints a single '.' character, unless --verbose is
       set to 0.  Therefore, unless --verbose is set to 0,
       the log  file  will contains  lot  of  dots. When the
       connection goes down it could be that iinnaaddyynn
       will print some error messages. Those are harmless
       and should be followed by 'OK' messages after the
       connection is back up.
