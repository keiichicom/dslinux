     ttrreekk is a game of space glory and war.  Below is
     a summary of commands.  For complete documentation,
     see _T_r_e_k by Eric Allman.

     If a filename is given, a log of the game is written
     onto that file.  If the --aa flag is given before the
     filename, that file is appended to, not truncated.

     The game will ask you what length game you would like.
     Valid responses are “short”, “medium”,
     and “long”.  You may also type “restart”,
     which restarts a previously saved game.  You will then
     be prompted for the skill, to which you must respond
     “novice”, “fair”, “good”, “expert”,
     “commodore”, or “impossible”.  You should normally
     start out with a novice and work up.

     In general, throughout the game, if you forget what is
     appropriate the game will tell you what it expects if
     you just type in a question mark.
