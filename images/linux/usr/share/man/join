       For  each  pair of input lines with identical join
       fields, write a line to standard output.  The default
       join field is the first, delimited  by whitespace.
       When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard
       input.

       --aa FILENUM
              print  unpairable  lines coming from file
              FILENUM, where FILENUM is 1 or 2, corresponding
              to FILE1 or FILE2

       --ee EMPTY
              replace missing input fields with EMPTY

       --ii, ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              ignore differences in case when comparing fields

       --jj FIELD
              equivalent to `-1 FIELD --22 FIELD'

       --oo FORMAT
              obey FORMAT while constructing output line

       --tt CHAR
              use CHAR as input and output field separator

       --vv FILENUM
              like --aa FILENUM, but suppress joined
              output lines

       --11 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 1

       --22 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 2

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       Unless --tt CHAR  is  given,  leading  blanks
       separate  fields  and  are ignored,  else fields are
       separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field num‐ ber
       counted from 1.  FORMAT is one or more  comma  or  blank
       separated specifications, each being `FILENUM.FIELD'
       or `0'.  Default FORMAT out‐ puts the join field,
       the remaining fields  from  FILE1,  the  remaining
       fields from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.

       Important:  FILE1  and  FILE2 must be sorted on the
       join fields.  E.g., use `sort --kk 1b,1' if `join'
       has no options.
