     ccrriibbbbaaggee plays the card game cribbage,
     with the program playing one hand and the user the other.
     The program will initially ask the user if the rules of
     the game are needed – if so, it will print out the
     appropriate section from _A_c_c_o_r_d_i_n_g
     _t_o _H_o_y_l_e with more(1).

     ccrriibbbbaaggee options include:

     --ee      When the player makes a mistake scoring his
     hand or crib, provide
             an explanation of the correct score.  (This is
             especially useful for beginning players.)

     --qq      Print a shorter form of all messages –
     this is only recommended
             for users who have played the game without
             specifying this option.

     --rr      Instead of asking the player to cut the deck,
     the program will
             randomly cut the deck.

     ccrriibbbbaaggee first asks the player whether
     he wishes to play a short game ( “once around”,
     to 61) or a long game ( “twice around”, to 121).
     A response of ‘ss’ will result in a short game,
     any other response will play a long game.

     At the start of the first game, the program asks the
     player to cut the deck to determine who gets the first
     crib.  The user should respond with a number between
     0 and 51, indicating how many cards down the deck is
     to be cut.  The player who cuts the lower ranked card
     gets the first crib.  If more than one game is played,
     the loser of the previous game gets the first crib in
     the current game.

     For each hand, the program first prints the player's hand,
     whose crib it is, and then asks the player to discard
     two cards into the crib.  The cards are prompted for
     one per line, and are typed as explained below.

     After discarding, the program cuts the deck (if it is
     the player's crib) or asks the player to cut the deck
     (if it's its crib); in the latter case, the appropriate
     response is a number from 0 to 39 indicating how far
     down the remaining 40 cards are to be cut.

     After cutting the deck, play starts with the non-dealer
     (the person who doesn't have the crib) leading the first
     card.  Play continues, as per cribbage, until all cards
     are exhausted.  The program keeps track of the scoring
     of all points and the total of the cards on the table.

     After play, the hands are scored.  The program requests
     the player to score his hand (and the crib, if it is his)
     by printing out the appropri‐ ate cards (and the cut
     card enclosed in brackets).  Play continues until one
     player reaches the game limit (61 or 121).

     A carriage return when a numeric input is expected is
     equivalent to typ‐ ing the lowest legal value; when
     cutting the deck this is equivalent to choosing the
     top card.

     Cards are specified as rank followed by suit.  The ranks
     may be specified as one of: ‘a’, ‘2’, ‘3’,
     ‘4’, ‘5’, ‘6’, ‘7’, ‘8’, ‘9’,
     ‘t’, ‘j’, ‘q’, and ‘k’, or alternatively,
     one of: ‘ace’, ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’,
     ‘five’, ‘six’, ‘seven’, ‘eight’,
     ‘nine’, ‘ten’, ‘jack’, ‘queen’, and
     ‘king’.  Suits may be specified as: ‘s’, ‘h’,
     ‘d’, and ‘c’, or alternatively as: ‘spades’,
     ‘hearts’, ‘diamonds’, and ‘clubs’.  A card
     may be specified as: “⟨rank⟩   ⟨suit⟩”, or:
     “⟨rank⟩ of ⟨suit⟩”.  If the single letter
     rank and suit designations are used, the space separating
     the suit and rank may be left out.  Also, if only one
     card of the desired rank is playable, typing the rank
     is sufficient.  For example, if your hand was “2H, 4D,
     5C, 6H, JC, and KD” and it was desired to discard the
     king of diamonds, any of the following could be typed:
     ‘k’, ‘king’, ‘kd’, ‘k d’, ‘k of d’,
     ‘king d’, ‘king of d’, ‘k diamonds’, ‘k of
     diamonds’, ‘king diamonds’, ‘king of diamonds’.
