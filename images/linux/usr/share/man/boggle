     The object of bbooggggllee is to find as many words
     as possible on the Boggle board within the three minute
     time limit.  A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement
     of Boggle cubes, each side of each cube displaying a
     letter of the alphabet or `qu'.  Words are formed by
     finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
     game's dictionary.  The (N+1)th cube in the word must be
     horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the
     Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be reused.  Words consist solely
     of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.

     Command line flags can be given to change the rules of
     the game.

     --bb         Run bbooggggllee in batch mode.
     A _b_o_a_r_d_s_p_e_c must also be given.
                The dictionary is read from stdin
                and a list of words appear‐ ing in
                _b_o_a_r_d_s_p_e_c is printed
                to stdout.

     --dd         Enable debugging output.

     --ss _s_e_e_d    Specify a seed _s_e_e_d other
     than the time of day.

     --tt _t_i_m_e    Set the time limit for each game
     from the default 3 minutes to
                _t_i_m_e seconds.

     --ww _l_e_n_g_t_h  Change the minimum word length
     from 3 letters to _l_e_n_g_t_h.

     _+          This flag allows a cube to be used multiple
     times, but not in
                succession.

     _+_+         This flag allows the same cubes to be
     considered adjacent to
                itself.

     _b_o_a_r_d_s_p_e_c  A starting board position
     can be specified on the command line
                by listing the board left to right and top
                to bottom.

     Help is available during play by typing ‘??’.
     More detailed information on the game is given there.

BBUUGGSS
     If there are a great many words in the cube the final
     display of the words may scroll off of the screen.
     (On a 25 line screen about 130 words can be displayed.)

     No word can contain a ‘q’ that is not immediately
     followed by a ‘u’.

     When using the _+ or _+_+ options the display of
     words found in the board doesn't indicate reused cubes.
