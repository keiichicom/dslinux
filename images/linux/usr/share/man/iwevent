       iiwweevveenntt display Wireless Events received
       through the RTNetlink  socket.  Each  line  display
       the specific Wireless Event which describe what
       has happened on the specified wireless interface.
       This command doesn't take any arguments.

       There is two classes of Wireless Events.

       The first class is events related to a change of
       wireless  settings  on the  interface  (typically
       done  through  iiwwccoonnffiigg or a script
       calling iiwwccoonnffiigg).  Only settings that
       could result in a disruption of  connec‐ tivity  are
       reported. The events currently reported are changing
       one of the following setting :
            _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _I_D _E_S_S_I_D
            _F_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y _M_o_d_e
            _E_n_c_r_y_p_t_i_o_n
       All those events will be generated on all wireless
       interfaces  by  the kernel wireless subsystem (but only
       if the driver has been converted to the new driver API).

       The second class of events are events generated by
       the  hardware,  when something happens or a task has
       been finished. Those events include :

       NNeeww AAcccceessss
       PPooiinntt//CCeellll aaddddrreessss
              The  interface  has joined a new Access Point
              or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost its association with
              it. This is the same MAC address  that is
              reported by iiwwccoonnffiigg.

       SSccaann rreeqquueesstt
       ccoommpplleetteedd
              A  scanning  request has been completed,
              results of the scan are available (see
              iiwwlliisstt).

       TTxx ppaacckkeett ddrrooppppeedd
              A packet directed at this address has been
              dropped  because  the interface  believes  this
              node  doesn't answer anymore (usually maximum
              of MAC level retry exceeded). This is usually
              an  early indication  that  the node may have
              left the cell or gone out of range, but it may
              be due to fading or excessive contention.

              Event specific to the driver. Please check the
              driver documenta‐ tion.

       RReeggiisstteerreedd nnooddee
              The   interface  has  successfully  registered
              a  new  wireless client/peer. Will be generated
              mostly when the interface act  as an Access Point
              (mode master).

       EExxppiirreedd nnooddee
              The  registration  of  the  client/peer  on
              this  interface has expired. Will be generated
              mostly when the interface act  as  an Access
              Point (mode master).

       SSppyy tthhrreesshhoolldd
       ccrroosssseedd
              The  signal strength for one of the address in
              the spy list went under the low threshold or
              went above than the high threshold.

       Most wireless drivers generate only a subset of those
       events,  not  all of  them, the exact list depends on
       the specific hardware/driver combi‐ nation. Please
       refer to driver documentation for details on  when
       they are generated, and use _i_w_l_i_s_t(8)
       to check what the driver supports.
