DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       IIwwssppyy  is  used to set a list of addresses
       in a wireless network inter‐ face and to read back
       quality of link information for  each  of  those.
       This information is the same as the one available in
       _/_p_r_o_c_/_n_e_t_/_w_i_r_e_l_e_s_s :
       quality of the link, signal strength and noise level.

       This information is updated each time a new packet is
       received, so each address of the list add some overhead
       in the driver.

       Note  the  this  functionality  work  only for node
       part of the current wireless cells.

PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
       You may set any number of addresses up to 8.

       DDNNSSNNAAMMEE | IIPPAADDDDRR
              Set an IP address, or in some cases a DNS name
              (using  the  name resolver).  As  the hardware
              work with hardware addresses, iiwwssppyy
              will translate this IP address through _A_R_P.
              In some case,  this address  might  not  be in
              the ARP cache and iiwwssppyy will fail. In
              those case, _p_i_n_g(8) this name/address
              and retry.

       HHWWAADDDDRR Set a hardware (MAC) address (this
       address is not  translated  &
              checked  like  the IP one). The address must
              contain a colon (::) to be recognised as a
              hardware address.

       ++      Add the new set of addresses at the  end  of
       the  current  list
              instead  of  replacing  it.  The address list
              is unique for each device, so each user should
              use this option to avoid conflicts.

       ooffff    Remove the current list of addresses and
       disable the  spy  func‐
              tionality

       sseetttthhrr Set  the  _l_o_w  and
       _h_i_g_h signal strength threshold for the iwspy
              event (for driver that support it).  Every time
              the signal strengh for any of the  address
              monitored with iwspy goes lower than the low
              threshold or goes higher than the high threshold,
              a Wireless Event will be generated.  This can
              be used to monitor link outages without having
              to  run iwspy periodically.

       ggeetttthhrr Retrieve  the current _l_o_w
       and _h_i_g_h signal strength threshold for
              the iwspy event.
