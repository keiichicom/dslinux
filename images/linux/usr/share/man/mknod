       Both MAJOR and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is
       b,  c,  or  u,  and they  must be omitted when TYPE
       is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x or 0X, it is
       interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it  begins
       with 0, as octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO
