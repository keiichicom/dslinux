     aarriitthhmmeettiicc asks you to solve problems
     in simple arithmetic.  Each ques‐ tion must be answered
     correctly before going on to the next.  After every 20
     problems, it prints the score so far and the time taken.
     You can quit at any time by typing the interrupt or
     end-of-file character.

     The options are as follows:

     --oo      By default, aarriitthhmmeettiicc
     asks questions on addition of numbers from
             0 to 10, and corresponding subtraction.
             By supplying one or more of the characters
             _+_-_x_/, you can ask for problems in
             addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
             division, respectively.  If you give one of
             these characters more than once, that kind of
             problem will be asked correspondingly more often.

     --rr      If a _r_a_n_g_e is supplied,
     aarriitthhmmeettiicc selects the numbers in its
             problems in the following way.  For addition
             and multiplication, the numbers to be added or
             multiplied are between 0 and _r_a_n_g_e,
             inclusive.  For subtraction and division, both the
             required result and the number to divide by or
             subtract will be between 0 and _r_a_n_g_e.
             (Of course, aarriitthhmmeettiicc will
             not ask you to divide by 0.)  The default is 10.

     When you get a problem wrong,
     aarriitthhmmeettiicc will remember the numbers
     involved, and will tend to select those numbers more
     often than others, in problems of the same sort.
     Eventually it will forgive and forget.

     aarriitthhmmeettiicc cannot be persuaded to tell
     you the right answer.  You must work it out for yourself.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     “What?” if you get a question wrong.  “Right!”
     if you get it right.  “Please type a number.” if
     aarriitthhmmeettiicc doesn't understand what
     you typed.
